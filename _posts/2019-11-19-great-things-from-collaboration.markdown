In my news feed, I noticed [https://gisgeography.com/history-of-gis/](https://gisgeography.com/history-of-gis/) pop up. I thought it was very interesting as a whole. However, the part that stuck out to me was this quote:

> Great discoveries and improvements invariably involve the cooperation of many minds.
> I may be given credit for having blaze the trail of GIS.

> -Roger Tomlinson

In all of the projects I have worked on, I have found this to be very true. When trust and collaboration exists, greater success ensues.

After seeing this quote, it brought to my mind the contribors popup on GitHub. You can see the many contributors of the main project. But, then there are also the many contributors of the dependencies listed as well.

This does not even begin to capture all of the contributions of the open-source community. There are so many tools out there that someone created and shared with the world. It is truly a magnificent thing to see. The more people share, the more others can build and share. It has quite the multiplying effect and is fun to be a part of.
